# Spotify Clone

This project contains a Spotify clone which is a responsive Progressive Web App designed with React and Material UI to replicate the features of Spotify - a music app. It fetches data from the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) and authorizes the user with a Google auth screen. Users can view the almost identical Spotify frontend and see the placeholder albums, artists, and song data.

```console git clone git@github.com:yevheniiairapetian/spotify-clone```
Or download directly by clicking on <> Code button > Download ZIP. Make sure you have Node installed on your machine. To check if you have Node installed, run the ```node -v``` command in the terminal. If Node is not installed, use the preferred package manager:
- For npm on Windows, run the ```npm install nodejs``` command 
- For Mac, run the ```brew install node``` command
- For Linux Debian/Ubuntu-based systems run the ```sudo apt-get install nodejs``` command
- For Red Hat/Fedora-based systems run the ```sudo yum install nodejs```
command
2. Then get back to the project folder and use the ```cd spotify-clone``` terminal command. Then run the ```npm i``` command (or similar, depending on the package manager) to install the project dependencies
  3. After that, run ```npm start``` in the console. The app will open in the browser.
  4. Click on ```Login with Spotify``` button and authorize with your preferred credentials.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
