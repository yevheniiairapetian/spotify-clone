# Spotify Clone

This project contains a Spotify clone which is a responsive Progressive Web App designed with React and React Bootstrap to replicate the features of Spotify - a music app. It fetches data from the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) and authorizes the user with a Google auth screen. Users can view the almost identical Spotify frontend and see the placeholder albums, artists, and song data.

[Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api)

## Available features

1. The frontend Spotify interface.
   Users can see information including (but not limited to):
   - Music Albums
   - Artists
   - Player controls
   - Search
   

2. Install the app on mobile/desktop devices like a native app.
When installed, it allows to:
- Use the app, resembling a native-app experience.
- Have an improved user experience
- Experience cross-platform compatibility
- Make use of faster loading times
- Use offline accessibility
- Have a smaller size than a native desktop app
- Access the app quickly via a mobile home screen, a Windows/Mac taskbar, etc

## Project Dependencies
- Node v 16
- React.js as a framework
- Material UI for styling
- Material UI icons for icons
- Reducer, Data layer
- External API [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) (for Spotify information)
- Service worker for enabling PWA functionality
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for deployment

## External API 
As mentioned, the app relies on the external API:

## Clone and Preview 
1. To clone the app use the following command:
```console git clone git@github.com:yevheniiairapetian/spotify-clone```
Or download directly by clicking on <> Code button > Download ZIP. Make sure you have Node installed on your machine. To check if you have Node installed, run the ```node -v``` command in the terminal. If Node is not installed, use the preferred package manager:
- For npm on Windows, run the ```npm install nodejs``` command 
- For Mac, run the ```brew install node``` command
- For Linux Debian/Ubuntu-based systems run the ```sudo apt-get install nodejs``` command
- For Red Hat/Fedora-based systems run the ```sudo yum install nodejs```
command
2. Then get back to the project folder and use the ```cd spotify-clone``` terminal command. Then run the ```npm i``` command (or similar, depending on the package manager) to install the project dependencies
  3. After that, run ```npm start``` in the console. The app will open in the browser.
  4. Click on ```Login with Spotify``` button and authorize with your preferred credentials.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
